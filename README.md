# lib
Name: DB2PD2XLS

Description: this project is a (personal) project about reading data from a web database. The data is read into a pandas dataframe. Ultimately the dataframe is exported to excel.

Limitations: the code is now static and relates to 1 specific database in relation to one specific research project.

Roadmap: the aim is, in due time, to generalize some aspects of the code

A sensible additional functionality would be adding the possibility to read the NWO database via an API call.
